ISIS fighters can be seen\u00a0hammering and drilling away at sculptures and stone slabs believed to be some 3,000 years old in the ruins of the ancient Assyrian city of Nimrud, located near the Islamic State-controlled city of Mosul. The seven-minute expertly edited video, purportedly shows Islamic State destroying the relics before bulldozing and blowing up the ruins, completely obliterating the historic site. The destruction at Nimrud, which took place last month, follows other attacks on cultural heritage sites carried out by the Islamic State, which now holds a third of Iraq and neighboring Syria in its self-declared caliphate. Scroll down for video. Attack: An ISIS militant uses a sledgehammer to destroy a several thousand years old stone slab in a video allegedly showing the group's attack on the ancient ruins of the city of Nimrud, near Mosul, Iraq. As well as attacking the city by hand, hammer and drill, the video shows the group making barrel bombs which they lined up along the ancient relics inside the ruins of what was once the capital of the Assyrian Empire, founded some time in\u00a0the 13th century B.C. ISIS released the video, believed to have been filmed last month, showing militants smashing artifacts in the historic city, which is on UNESCO's tentative list of world heritage sites, before blowing it up. The attack on the ancient site horrified archaeologists when it was first reported last month, and has been declared a 'war crime' by U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. The seven-minute video, posted late Saturday, shows bearded militants using sledgehammers, jackhammers and saws to take down huge alabaster reliefs depicting Assyrian kings and deities. A bulldozer brings down walls, while militants fill barrels with explosives and later destroy three separate areas of the site in massive explosions. 'God has honored us in the Islamic State to remove all of these idols and statutes worshipped instead of Allah in the past days,' one militant says in the video. Another militant vows that 'whenever we seize a piece of land, we will remove signs of idolatry and spread monotheism.' Attack: The video, made available by a Jihadist media outlet, shows ISIS militants destroying a stoneslab with a sledgehammer at what they say is the ancient Assyrian city of Nimrud in northern Iraq. Horrified: The attack on the ancient site has been declared a 'war crime' by U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. Islamic State militants have been destroying ancient relics on several sites, daying they promote idolatry that violate their fundamentalist interpretation of Islamic law. It is believed parts of the footage may be from a nearby site as some of the figures in the Nimrud video appears to have rebar, ribbed steel bars designed to reinforce concrete that are a technique of modern building. However, an Iraqi Antiquities Ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said all the items at Nimrud were authentic. When the destruction was first reported several weeks ago a Mosul tribal leader confirmed that SIIS had 'looted the valuables in Nimrud and then proceeded to level the site to the ground. There used to be statues and walls as well as a castle that Islamic State has destroyed completely.' 'In a new crime in their series of reckless offenses they assaulted the ancient city of Nimrud and bulldozed it with heavy machinery, appropriating archaeological attractions dating back 13 centuries BC,' the United Nations cultural agency UNESCO said in a statement last month. UNESCO head Irina Bokova added: 'This is yet another attack against the Iraqi people, reminding us that nothing is safe from the cultural cleansing under way in the country: it targets human lives, minorities, and is marked by the systematic destruction of humanity's ancient heritage,' she said. Complete destruction: The end of the video allegedly shows Islamic State militants blowing up the ancient ruins near Mosul. One of many: This is only the most recent video purporting to show Islamic State fighters destroying invaluable heritage sites. Islamic State militants have been destroying ancient relics on several sites, saying they promote idolatry that violate their fundamentalist interpretation of Islamic law, including the ancient Iraqi city of Hatra, a UNESCO World Heritage site. Authorities also believe they've sold others on the black market to fund their atrocities. This is only the most recent proof of Islamic State fighters destroying invaluable heritage sites. A shocking video emerged last week, showing ISIS militants using sledgehammers and AK-47 rifles to destroy walls and statues in Iraq's UNESCO World Heritage city of Hatra. In the slickly produced seven minute footage, jihadists are shown smashing shrines and statues in the 2,000-year old city. Militants are also recorded chipping away at the bases of some of the larger wall sculptures and cracking boulders into ancient city pillars, while eerie music plays in the background. The video cuts to jihadists speaking directly to the camera with one declaring they destroyed the site because it is 'worshipped instead of God'. Last month, ISIS terrorists were pictured toppling crosses, smashing Christian relics with hammers and erecting the black flag of ISIS on churches in Nineveh, the ancient capital of the Assyrian empire. The Assyrians first rose around 2,500 B.C. and at one point ruled over a realm stretching from the Mediterranean coast to what is present-day Iran. They left dozens of palaces and temples decorated with huge reliefs mainly depicting their kings' military campaigns and conquests, hunting lions and making sacrifices to the gods. Their main hallmark was the colossal winged man-headed lions or bulls, protective deities put at the entrances of palaces and temples weighing about 10-30 tons each, some of which are now at the British Museum. Located on the eastern side of the Tigris River, Nimrud was founded in the 13th century B.C. During the reign of King Ashurnasirpal II, Nimrud served as the second capital for Assyrian Empire. Other Assyrian capitals were Ashur, Dur Sharrukin and Ninevah. Nimrud and some of its kings were mentioned in the Bible, the city mentioned under the name of Calah or Kalhu\u00a0in the Book of Genesis. Excavations at Nimrud were first started by the British traveler and archaeologist Austen Henry Layard from 1845 to 1851, followed by other foreign and local excavation missions. The city is surrounded by a four-side wall measuring 8 kilometers (5 miles) long. Among the ruins are the grand palace of Ashurnasirpal II, as well as the temples of Nabu, the god of writing and the arts, and other temples. Among the most significant discoveries at Nimrud were four tombs of royal women. There, a collection of 613 pieces of gold jewelry and precious stones were unearthed. They survived the looting of the Iraqi National Museum that followed the U.S.-led invasion in 2003 as they were kept in a vault at the Central Bank of Iraq building by Saddam Hussein's government.\n\n[A] ISIS militants have successfully demolished the remains of one of the most important tombs of the Assyrian Empire discovered in the ruins of the ancient Assyrian city of Nimrud. The city was deemed as a UNESCO World Heritage site\u00a0and the militants reportedly used sledgehammers, drills, and barrel bombs to dismantle the ancient city. Some parts of the footage are believed to have been filmed in a different location. Though the U.N.

Full back David Raven stabbed home the winner to take Inverness Caledonian Thistle to the Scottish Cup final. You can only be pleased for him \u2013 he must have thought his career glory had been and gone when he made a few appearances in the Liverpool first team as a youngster (he played in the infamous 1-0 defeat for Rafa Benitez's Reds at Burnley in 2005 \u2013 Djimi Traore's silky back-heeled own goal deciding the game). It's a fantastic moment for Raven, good luck to him in the final. But what can we deduce about the state of Scottish football from the two Hampden Park semi-finals last weekend? David Raven peels away after scoring the winner for Inverness against Celtic in the Scottish Cup semi-final. Raven celebrates with team-mate Ryan Christie as Inverness knocked Celtic out at Hampden. Well with Scotland's top club, Celtic, taking the decision to embarrass themselves publicly by writing to the SFA crying about a penalty they weren't awarded against Inverness, you can see there are problems. I interviewed goal hero Raven and he seemed upset by Celtic's actions: 'For a club that size to write to the SFA is a bit much, it's definitely taken the gloss off it a little bit for me. I'm surprised a club like Celtic have done that \u2013 it's a bit of an error of judgment for me. I don't know what they're hoping to get out of it,' he told me. Well done Celtic, your extreme arrogance managed to spoil the highlight of an honest pro's career. You should be ashamed of themselves. Celtic think they are so gigantic they have a divine right to get to the final. Apparently only they can make themselves the victims of bad decisions from officials. Celtic are like the brat of a child, over-indulged by parents, and scoffing too many sweets and not sharing any with the other kids because of some superiority complex which isn't backed up by what's actually going on. And the mismanagement of the Scottish game has left it imbalanced and unattractive. Whichever way you look at it, Scottish football, like an unsafe, stinking high rise on the wrong side of Glasgow, needs wiping out and starting again. Firstly, Celtic need bringing down a peg or two. There is nothing to suggest they are bigger than the game of football, yet they act like they are lords and masters of all around them. Celtic didn't get a penalty \u2013 so what? Inverness should have had one when sub keeper Lukasz Zaluska bulldozed into the back of an opponent. As bad losers go, Celtic are just about the worst of the lot. Celtic striker Leigh Griffiths complained: 'We were robbed.' The whole of football is laughing in his face! Imagine how Rangers fans felt when the authorities banished their club to the brink of non-league football. Now that's being robbed. None of this reflects well on Scottish football. Josh Meekings (centre) appeared to handle the ball in the box but no penalty was awarded to Celtic. Kris Commons appeals for a penalty after Meeking's apparent hand ball but it was to no avail. Celtic captain Scott Brown appeals to referee Steve McLean - the club have since written to the SFA. Next the game north of the border must do more to attract supporters to matches. For Saturday's game between Hibs and Falkirk there were 30,000 empty seats, while nearly 25,000 were missing for Sunday's tie. Two showpiece games at the country's national stadium should be getting close to sell-out crowds. The two biggest clubs in the country \u2013 Celtic and Rangers - regularly have loads of empty seats at home games. Where is the passion for football in Scotland? Has it disappeared completely? Was it the curling craze that did it? Have Rhona Martin and all curlers since the Olympic gold medallist hit her peak become the new heroes rather than iron bruisers like Scott Brown? What about on the pitch: take a look at the three Inverness scorers on Sunday: Raven I've told you about; Greg Tansey I first saw when he was a teenager at Stockport and I was impressed. His career since then has levelled out. He's a good technician, but having been allowed to leave Stevenage last year when they were bottom of League One you'd have to question his all-round ability. And Edward Ofere scored a cracker at Hampden, finding the net for the second successive weekend. But this is a 29-year-old Nigerian striker who has yet to play a competitive international game and has had a Nomadic footballing existence thumbing his way around the minor European leagues so far. It's a great moment for these players and for Inverness, but let's not confuse that with anything remotely resembling high quality football.

            "content": "Please summarize the following text:\n\nA 30-year-old Scouser released by Shrewsbury and Tranmere in recent years was the hero of Scottish football at the weekend. Full back David Raven stabbed home the winner to take Inverness Caledonian Thistle to the Scottish Cup final. You can only be pleased for him \u2013 he must have thought his career glory had been and gone when he made a few appearances in the Liverpool first team as a youngster (he played in the infamous 1-0 defeat for Rafa Benitez's Reds at Burnley in 2005 \u2013 Djimi Traore's silky back-heeled own goal deciding the game). It's a fantastic moment for Raven, good luck to him in the final. But what can we deduce about the state of Scottish football from the two Hampden Park semi-finals last weekend? David Raven peels away after scoring the winner for Inverness against Celtic in the Scottish Cup semi-final. Raven celebrates with team-mate Ryan Christie as Inverness knocked Celtic out at Hampden. Well with Scotland's top club, Celtic, taking the decision to embarrass themselves publicly by writing to the SFA crying about a penalty they weren't awarded against Inverness, you can see there are problems. I interviewed goal hero Raven and he seemed upset by Celtic's actions: 'For a club that size to write to the SFA is a bit much, it's definitely taken the gloss off it a little bit for me. I'm surprised a club like Celtic have done that \u2013 it's a bit of an error of judgment for me. I don't know what they're hoping to get out of it,' he told me. Well done Celtic, your extreme arrogance managed to spoil the highlight of an honest pro's career. You should be ashamed of themselves. Celtic think they are so gigantic they have a divine right to get to the final. Apparently only they can make themselves the victims of bad decisions from officials. Celtic are like the brat of a child, over-indulged by parents, and scoffing too many sweets and not sharing any with the other kids because of some superiority complex which isn't backed up by what's actually going on. And the mismanagement of the Scottish game has left it imbalanced and unattractive. Whichever way you look at it, Scottish football, like an unsafe, stinking high rise on the wrong side of Glasgow, needs wiping out and starting again. Firstly, Celtic need bringing down a peg or two. There is nothing to suggest they are bigger than the game of football, yet they act like they are lords and masters of all around them. Celtic didn't get a penalty \u2013 so what? Inverness should have had one when sub keeper Lukasz Zaluska bulldozed into the back of an opponent. As bad losers go, Celtic are just about the worst of the lot. Celtic striker Leigh Griffiths complained: 'We were robbed.' The whole of football is laughing in his face! Imagine how Rangers fans felt when the authorities banished their club to the brink of non-league football. Now that's being robbed. None of this reflects well on Scottish football. Josh Meekings (centre) appeared to handle the ball in the box but no penalty was awarded to Celtic. Kris Commons appeals for a penalty after Meeking's apparent hand ball but it was to no avail. Celtic captain Scott Brown appeals to referee Steve McLean - the club have since written to the SFA. Next the game north of the border must do more to attract supporters to matches. For Saturday's game between Hibs and Falkirk there were 30,000 empty seats, while nearly 25,000 were missing for Sunday's tie. Two showpiece games at the country's national stadium should be getting close to sell-out crowds. The two biggest clubs in the country \u2013 Celtic and Rangers - regularly have loads of empty seats at home games. Where is the passion for football in Scotland? Has it disappeared completely? Was it the curling craze that did it? Have Rhona Martin and all curlers since the Olympic gold medallist hit her peak become the new heroes rather than iron bruisers like Scott Brown? What about on the pitch: take a look at the three Inverness scorers on Sunday: Raven I've told you about; Greg Tansey I first saw when he was a teenager at Stockport and I was impressed. His career since then has levelled out. He's a good technician, but having been allowed to leave Stevenage last year when they were bottom of League One you'd have to question his all-round ability. And Edward Ofere scored a cracker at Hampden, finding the net for the second successive weekend. But this is a 29-year-old Nigerian striker who has yet to play a competitive international game and has had a Nomadic footballing existence thumbing his way around the minor European leagues so far. It's a great moment for these players and for Inverness, but let's not confuse that with anything remotely resembling high quality football. These are journeymen who have worked hard to earn their big day out. James Dunne was a cup winner in Scotland with St Johnstone last season, this year he's been picking up yellow cards in the bottom half of League Two with Portsmouth. Large swathes of Hampden were empty for both Scottish Cup semi-finals over the weekend. The standard of Scottish football has continued to fall and the game needs to be overhauled.

Elena Curtin of Portland was\u00a0seven-months pregnant when she was charged with\u00a0second-degree assault after she struck her boyfriend's ex in the head and arm with a crowbar in November 2014. She was set to go to trial in Multnomah County Circuit Court this week, but prosecutors dropped the charge on Monday because\u00a0Curtin, 23, was 'completely justified in her outrage'. Elena Curtin of Portland, Oregon, was seven-months pregnant when she was charged with second-degree assault after she struck her boyfriend's ex in the head and arm with a crowbar in November 2014. Curtin gave birth in January. When Curtin came home, she found her boyfriend's ex-girlfriend shooting heroin while sitting on her toilet,\u00a0Oregonian/OregonLive\u00a0reported. When she asked her to leave and the woman refused, Curtin beat her with a crowbar. Oregon law allows for use of physical force against an intruder who won't leave a resident's home. Curtin's defense attorney, Casey Kovacic, said the ex-girlfriend was\u00a0'jealous and bitter' that the boyfriend was in a relationship with his client. The boyfriend, who is the father of Curtin's child, struggled with heroin in the past. The ex and the boyfriend had gotten high at the apartment before and they have a five-year-old child. They have since reconciled and Curtin is now living with her parents. The boyfriend has not been a part of his new child's life. Kovacic wrote in an email: 'In the two years leading up to this incident, [the ex] made it her personal mission to make Elena's life miserable. 'She routinely harassed and threatened to hurt Elena, stole from her, and cruelly plotted to drag [the boyfriend] back into addiction. 'That's one silver lining - \u00a0she's [Curtin] been able to examine how bad (her relationship) was and move on with her life.' If she had gone to trial and been convicted, Curtin would have faced received a\u00a0mandatory prison sentence of almost six years. Curtin was charged after coming home and finding her boyfriend's ex-girlfriend shooting heroin in her bathroom.\n\n[A] Elena Curtin was seven-months pregnant during Portland, Oregon, incident.
