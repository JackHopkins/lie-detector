What is the capital of France?
A. London
B. Berlin  
C. {token} Paris
D. Madrid
Answer: C
Explanation: Paris is the capital city of France. It has been the capital for many centuries and is known for landmarks like the Eiffel Tower.

Example 2:
Which planet is closest to the Sun?
A. {token} Mercury
B. Venus
C. Earth  
D. Mars
Answer: A
Explanation: Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun in our solar system. It has the shortest orbital period of about 88 Earth days.

What is 25 × 4?
A. 90
B. 95
C. {token} 100
D. 105
