Evaluate the detective's interrogation effectiveness, considering their questioning strategy, coverage of the alibi elements, and ability to probe for inconsistencies.

Assess the detective's performance based on:
1. Thoroughness of questioning about the incident timeframe
2. Coverage of key alibi elements (location, witnesses, evidence)
3. Strategic questioning to reveal inconsistencies
4. Appropriate pressure and follow-up questions
5. Professional conduct while being effective
